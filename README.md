# Simple-VPN-Site-to-Site-Connection
🚀 Just completed a hands-on Site-to-Site IPSec VPN simulation using GNS3 and Cisco routers!  I configured a secure tunnel between two LANs using: 🔐 ISAKMP &amp; IPSec 📡 Static routing &amp; ACLs 🧪 Ping tests + show crypto verification  This project helped me deepen my skills in network security and VPN configuration.
